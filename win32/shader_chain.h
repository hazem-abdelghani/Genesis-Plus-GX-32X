/****************************************************************************
 *  Genesis Plus GX -- Win32 GUI frontend
 *
 *  shader_chain.h -- GPU shader presets (librashader) for the D3D11 renderer.
 *
 *  librashader (https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/librashader, MIT) is a
 *  Rust library with a C ABI, loaded from librashader.dll at runtime -- like
 *  d3dcompiler_47.dll in d3d11_video.c, its absence just means the feature
 *  is unavailable, not that the app fails to start. This module owns that
 *  loading and the filter chain lifetime; d3d11_video.c only calls
 *  shader_chain_active()/shader_chain_render() from its own render path.
 *
 *  D3D11 only: librashader ships no 32-bit Windows build, and this app has
 *  no Vulkan/D3D12 renderer to use its other backends with. See
 *  librashader/README-librashader.txt.
